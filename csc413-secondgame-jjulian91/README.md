## *note*: 
High Score table does not hold record outside of IDE. This could be corrected but the scope of the project 
does not lend itself to build a database to store file too.  Jars are meant to be signed and secure, by changing
the data inside the jar it invalidates the security.  Storing the file outside of the jar makes the jar less portable.
To write outside of the jar into an external resource all that needs to be changed are the paths for buffered reader/writer.
